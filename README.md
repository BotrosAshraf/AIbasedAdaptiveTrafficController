# 🚦 Smart Intersection Simulation (AI-Based)

> **A simulation built with Unreal Engine 5 that explores a non-linear approach to solving traffic congestion.**

## 📖 About The Project | عن المشروع
This project tackles the classic problem of **Intersection Congestion** but with a twist. Instead of traditional traffic lights or standard lanes, this simulation applies a concept **"Opposite to Lines"**.

The system treats vehicles as dynamic agents that negotiate the intersection fluidly, reducing wait times and preventing gridlocks typically caused by rigid lane structures.

**Key Idea:**
* Moving away from strict "Lanes" logic.
* Dynamic pathfinding for vehicles.
* Optimized flow at high-density intersections.

## 🛠️ Built With | التقنيات المستخدمة
* **Engine:** Unreal Engine 5 (UE5)
* **Language:** C++ (Core Logic) & Blueprints (Behavior)
* **AI:** Custom Navigation & Avoidance System

## 🚀 How to Run | طريقة التشغيل
1.  Clone the repository:
